# VSLook

## ðŸŒŸ Features

### Flexible

VSLook set the new theme on the top of active theme. So only the part you wanna change get changed across all theme.

### Color Palettes

Since most of us are not designers, we may find difficulties in picking colors. So I have added some popular color palettes to help us.
